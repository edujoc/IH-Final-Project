# Data Analysis Bootcamp Final Project 

## How do you assign a lead score to each lead in order to increase conversion rates?
Edu Jockers, Data Analysis Bootcamp, Berlin 2021

### Introduction
Sales and marketing teams put in a lot of time and effort to assess the quality of leads.A 1% boost in lead conversion rate might save any organization thousands/millions of dollars. It is not only about putting effort into leads that have a high chance of converting, but also about putting work into leads that have a low chance of converting. Organizations may benefit from machine learning in this endeavor. The general purpose of this project is to assign a lead score to each lead such that customers with a higher lead score have a greater conversion probability and customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.

### Objective
Create a logistic regression model to provide a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads. A higher value indicates that the lead is hot, i.e. itâ€™s most likely to convert, whereas a lower value indicates that the lead is not hot and will most likely not be converted.
